All source code is my original work. I did not share nor copy code from resources other than what is provided from my Professor, Judi McCuaig.

Navigation keys:
The well-known "WASD" navigation is implemented in this program. W is up, A is left, S is down, and D is right. The standard UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow keys are also implemented for player navigation if preferred.

Single character commands:
- 'r' will let the player know what room they are currently in (eg, You are in Room 2 (total rooms: 2))
- 'i' will list the items in the player's inventory (eg, Inventory: 6 gold, Mango, Health Potion)
