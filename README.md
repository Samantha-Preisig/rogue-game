# Rogue Game
A simple implementation of a dungeon-crawling video game using Java The character can travel between room , collect distinct items, and view inventory.

### Navigation keys:
- The well-known "WASD" navigation is implemented in this program:
  - `W` is up
  - `A` is left
  - `S` is down
  - `D` is right
- The standard `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` arrow keys are also implemented for player navigation if preferred.

### Extra commands:
- `r` let's the player know what room they are currently in (eg, "You are in Room 2 (total rooms: 2)")
- `i` will list the items in the player's inventory (eg, "Inventory: 6 gold, Mango, Health Potion")
